      Depending on the environment, loading data from e.g. an I2C EEPROM may fail occasionally with
      bad CRCs due to noise in the communication. This Kconfig defines how often reading from the
      storage should be retried.

      changed.

      This version number has to be increased each time IDs previously used for data objects
      stored in non-volatile memory are re-used for different data objects (different data type
      or different semantics).

      Warning: This will discard previously stored data in order to prevent data corruption. Try
      to avoid changing data object IDs used previously.
